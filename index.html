<h1>What is education?</h1>
<p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
     morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion
      and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, 
      learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, 
      and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be 
      considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

    Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten,
     primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions,
      education is compulsory up to a certain age.
    
    There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
    towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at 
    large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by 
    some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable 
    Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>
    <h2>What is the history of education?</h2>
    <p>Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills 
        deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally
         and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one 
         generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that
          could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed 
          in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.

        Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.
         The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the 
         intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 
         3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization 
         following the fall of Rome in CE 476.
        
        In China, Confucius (551–479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most
         influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence 
         the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius
          gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals 
          for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued 
          to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.
        
        The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent 
        word in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art of raising or educating a person",
         or "the art of strengthening or bringing up men". This was a broad conceptualization of 
         education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and 
         reinforced by community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone 
         regardless of social class and gender.[8] There was also the word neixtlamachiliztli, which
          is "the act of giving wisdom to the face." These concepts underscore a complex set of
           educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next generation 
           the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the purpose of individual 
           development and his integration into the community.
        
        After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole
         preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe. The church established cathedral 
         schools in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these 
         establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many
          of Europe's modern universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral
           operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities
            of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged 
            freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers,
             including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University 
             of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation,
              and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research. Founded in 1088,
               the University of Bologne is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating
                university.
        
        Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, Islamic science and mathematics flourished under the 
        Islamic caliphate which was established across the Middle East, extending from the Iberian 
        Peninsula in the west to the Indus in the east and to the Almoravid Dynasty and Mali Empire 
        in the south.
        
        The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual
         inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450,
          Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature
           to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education
            in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries
             and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations – as with the Jesuit
              China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science
              , and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's 
              Elements for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. 
              The Enlightenment saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.
               Much of modern traditional Western and Eastern education is based on the Prussian 
               education system.
        
        In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or otherwise,
         is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation
          of compulsory education, combined with population growth, UNESCO has calculated
           that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal education than in all
            of human history thus far.</p>
